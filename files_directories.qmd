# Working with Files and Directories

Let's create a new directory called thesis using the command `mkdir QE` (which has no output):

```{python}
#| eval: false
mkdir QE
```

As you might guess from its name, `mkdir` means "make directory". Since `QE` is a relative path (i.e., doesn't have a leading slash), the new directory is created in the current working directory:

Since we've just created the `QE` directory, there's nothing in it yet:

```{python}
ls -F QE
```

Let's change our working directory to `QE` using `cd`, then run a text editor called `vi` to create a file called `si.in` :

```{python}
#| eval: false
$ cd QE

```

```{python}
#| eval: false

$ vi si.in
```

### Which Editor?

Text editors can be used for writing code, editing text files such as configuration files, creating user instruction files, and many more. In Linux, text editors are of two kinds that is the graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line text editors (console or terminal).

### **Vi/Vim Editor**

[Vim](https://www.tecmint.com/install-vim-in-linux/ "How to Install Latest Vim Editor in Linux Systems") is a powerful command-line based text editor that has enhanced the functionalities of the old Unix [Vi text editor](https://www.tecmint.com/vi-editor-usage/ "How to Install and Use vi/vim as a Full Text Editor – Part 2"). It is one the most popular and widely used text editors among System Administrators and programmers that is why many users often refer to it as a programmer\'s editor.

### Creating Files in Different way

We have seen how to create text files using the `vi/vim` editor. Now, try the following command in your home directory:

touch QE/si.out
```
