# Pipes and Filters

Now that we know a few basic commands, we can finally look at the shell’s most powerful feature: the ease with which it lets us combine existing programs in new ways. We’ll start with a directory called molecules that contains six files describing some simple organic molecules.

```{python}
#| eval: false

$ ls mini_workshop/Si
```


Let’s go into that directory with cd and run the command `wc *.in`. `wc` is the “word count” command: it counts the number of lines, words, and characters in files (from left to right, in that order).

```{python}
#| eval: false

cd mini_workshop/Si
$ wc *.in
```
