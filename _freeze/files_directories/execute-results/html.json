Since `QE` is a relative path (i.e., doesn't have a leading slash), the new directory is created in the current working directory:\n\nSince we've just created the `QE` directory, there's nothing in it yet:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=2}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\nls -F QE\n```\n:::\n\n\nLet's change our working directory to `QE` using `cd`, then run a text editor called `vi` to create a file called `si.in` :\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=3}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n$ cd QE\n```\n:::\n\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=4}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\n$ vi si.in\n```\n:::\n\n\n### Which Editor?\n\nText editors can be used for writing code, editing text files such as configuration files, creating user instruction files, and many more. In Linux, text editors are of two kinds that is the graphical user interface (GUI) and command-line text editors (console or terminal).\n\n### **Vi/Vim Editor**\n\n[Vim](https://www.tecmint.com/install-vim-in-linux/ \"How to Install Latest Vim Editor in Linux Systems\") is a powerful command-line based text editor that has enhanced the functionalities of the old Unix [Vi text editor](https://www.tecmint.com/vi-editor-usage/ \"How to Install and Use vi/vim as a Full Text Editor – Part 2\"). It is one the most popular and widely used text editors among System Administrators and programmers that is why many users often refer to it as a programmer\\'s editor.\n\n::: callout-tip\n## Vi/Vim Save and Quit command\n\nThe procedure to save a file in vi/vim and quit the editor is as follows:\n\n1.  open the file with `vi filename( e.g vi si.in)`\n2.  to save a file and quit press `Esc` key , type `` :wq ( or `:x`) ``\n3.  hit `Enter` key\n:::\n\n\n\n### Creating Files in Different way\n\nWe have seen how to create text files using the `vi/vim` editor. Now, try the following command in your home directory:\n\n::: {.cell execution_count=5}\n``` {.python .cell-code}\ntouch QE/si.out\n```\n:::\n\n\n",
